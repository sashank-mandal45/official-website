          <p>
            The universe is everything. It includes all of space, and all the matter and energy that space contains. It even includes time itself and, of course, it includes you. Earth and the Moon are part of the universe, as are the other planets and their many dozens of moons. Along with asteroids and comets, the planets orbit the Sun. The Sun is one among hundreds of billions of stars in the Milky Way galaxy, and most of those stars have their own planets, known as exoplanets.

          <h3>Coding</h3>
          <p>
            When you're starting your coding journey, one of the most exciting – and at times overwhelming – things about it is just how much there is to learn. You'll discover different languages, frameworks, libraries, inventions and conventions. One technology often requires knowledge of another one, and everything seems to be interconnected and intertwined.
